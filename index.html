    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I created this website as a portfolio project for Holberton School. I have always been interested in ecommerce and how it works. I wanted to learn how to build a website that can handle transactions, user accounts, and product listings. I also wanted to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project took me about two months to complete, and I am very proud of the result.</p>
